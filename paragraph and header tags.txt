     <h3> <u> Music </u> </h3>
         <p> Music is an art form, and cultural activity, whose medium is sound. 
             General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch, 
             rhythm, dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture.
             Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and 
             vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; 
             there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces
             and pieces that combine singing and instruments.
