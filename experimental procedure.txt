      <h3> <font face="Monotype Corosiva" size="5" color="Purple"> <u> Description </u> : </font> </h3>
          <p> Carry Foster bridge consists of a uniform wire EF of 
              length 1 m, stretched on a wooden board. 
              The ends of the wire are soldered to the ends of the two
              L-shaped copper strips fixed at the extreme ends of the board.
              Three copper strips are fixed in between the L-shaped strips 
              such that there are four gaps in between.A movable jockey is provided
              using which contact can be made at any point on the wire. 
              A meter stick is fixed on the board parallel to the length of the wire EF. </p>

      <h3> <font face="Monotype Corosiva" size="5" color="Purple"> <u> Procedure </u> : </font> </h3>
          <p> The connections are made as shown in the figure (in comparison with the Wheatstone's Bridge).
              P and Q are the two equal standard resistance; R is a two
              dial decade resistance box; L is a Leclanche cell; K is the Plug Key;
              G is the table galvanometer; HR is the High resistance; J is the Jockey; X is the given
              resistance wire (resistance and specific resistance to be found).
        
      <h4> To Find The Resistance Of The Bridge Wire (r) : </h4>
          <p> In the extreme left gap, a thick copper strip (Resistance 0 ohm) is connected. 
              In the extreme right gap a resistance of 0.1 ohm is taken in the Resistance box R. 
              The balance point J is found and the balancing lengths EJ = L1 meter is measured.
              Now the thick copper strip and 0.1 ohm (Resistance box) are interchanged in their gaps and 
              again the balance point J is found and the balancing length EJ = L2 meter is measured.
              Then the resistance of the bridge wire r is calculated.
              The experiment is repeated for R = 0.2 Ω, 0.3 Ω, 0.4 Ω, 0.5 Ω.
              In each case r is found and the mean value of r is calculated. </p>
              
      <h4> To Find The Resistance (X) Of The Given Wire : </h4>
          <p> In the extreme left the gap the given wire is connected.
              In the extreme right gap resistance box R is connected. 
              The Jockey is pressed at 0.5 m of the scale of the bridge.
              The circuit is closed. The resistance in the box R is adjusted till 
              the deflection in the galvanometer is zero or almost zero. Let R = 3.4 Ω,
              the correct balance point J is found. The balancing length EJ = L1 m is measured.
              The experiment is repeated for R = 3.3 Ω; 3.2 Ω; 3.5 Ω; 3.6 Ω.
              In each case the correct balance point and balancing lengths are
              measured. The values are tabulated. </p>
                   
          <p> Now the resistance wire and resistance box R are interchanged in their gaps
              and the experiment is repeated for the same resistance values. 
              The correct balancing point J is found and the balancing length EJ = L2 m is measured in each case.
              The values are tabulated. The Resistance of the given wire X is calculated. </p>
                                       
          <p> The given wire is stretched on a metre stick and its length l is measured.
              Using a screw gauge the diameter of the wire is found at various places along its length.
              Then the mean radius of the wire a (diameter/2) is found.
              The Specific Resistance of the material of the given wire is found using the formula given. </p>
